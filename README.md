# Malignant-Comments-Classifier

Domain : Information Technology

Tech Stack : Python, Jupyter NoteBook, Google Colab NoteBook

Objective : The proloferation of Social Media enables people to express thier opinions widely online. However, at the same time, this has resulted in the emergence of conflict and hate, making online environment uninviting for users. This project aims to build models for online hate detection.

Solution: The dataset with comments extracted from various social media platforms are analysed. Natural Language Processing Techniques were applied on the comments. RNN model was built using Deep Leaning Techniques.

Achievments : Bi-Directional LSTM Model predicted the probablities for each category to which the comment belongs with AUC of 98.28, loss of 0.05 and accuracy of 98.58%
